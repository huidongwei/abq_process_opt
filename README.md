### **Summary**
Poly (lactic acid) (PLA) has a broad perspective for manufacturing green thermoplastic products by thermoforming <br>
for its biodegradable properties. The mechanical behaviour of PLA has been demonstrated by its strong dependence <br>
on temperature and strain rate at biaxial deformation. A nonlinear viscoelastic model by the previous study <br>
was employed in a thermoforming process used for food packaging. <br>
An optimisation approach was developed by achieving the optimal temperature profile of specimens <br>
by defining multiple heating zones based on numerical modelling with finite element analysis (FEA). <br> 
The forming process of a PLA product was illustrated by modelling results on shape evolution <br>
and biaxial strain history. The optimal temperature profile was suggested in scalloped zones <br>
to achieve more even thickness distribution. The sensitivity of the optimal results was addressed <br>
by checking the robustness under perturbation
